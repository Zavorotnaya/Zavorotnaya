## About me 
I'm a QA Engineer Junior for manual testing with a background as a
quality control manager. Also, I have strong theoretical knowledge in QA
theory.
Now I'm doing my internship at "New Technologies" startup. I'm eager for
new knowledge and fascinating challenges. I'm interested in working with
backend and I'm going to evolve as a QA Automation Engineer in the
future.
I'm a thoughtful and meticulous person. I love accuracy and trust digits
and facts. Also, I'm inclined to consider the projects I work on thoroughly
and I think a step ahead.
I'm dreaming of working on a product that will be able to help developing
business and make customers' lives better.
